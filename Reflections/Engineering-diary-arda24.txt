Engineer’s Diary

03-09-2024

I created a group with Kim, André, and Jesper. We also made a Discord server where we discuss what we are going to do and share links to good 
resources for the project.

We sat in the Ericsson lab and read through the assignment together to ensure everyone was on the same page and to check if anyone had any 
questions or suggestions.

05-09-2024

During the lab session, we sat down as a group and discussed which programs we would use. We decided on the following: Jetbrains, Docker, JDK, 
IntelliJ, VS Code, Python, and GitHub.
After installing the environments we needed, we sat together as a group and started learning how GitHub works and how to use its various 
features like push, pull, fork, and branch to gain an understanding. We also 
worked on some exercises in Java.
Afterward, we created a GitHub repository where we write our engineering diaries.

10-09-2024

We created a document where we document what needs to be done and how we will do it.
This will be our manual for how to proceed with the assignment.
We also set up our GitHub flow and discussed how to branch and push our various files.
We divided the work regarding who will handle which product type. I took drinks, André took hamburgers, Kim took menus, and Jesper took side 
dishes.
I filled out my list with different types of drinks and their sizes.

Since the last time I updated the diary, we have gone through each other’s product types and added what we think a typical burger place would 
have. We still have some more changes to make and things to add.
We also decided to name our burger place "Four Guy’s." We came up with this name because, like the popular American hamburger chain "Five 
Guy’s," which was founded by five guys, we are four guys making our own fast-
food chain.

During the lab, my group and I practiced debugging in Java within VS Code. We used the debugging tools provided by VS Code to gain a deeper 
understanding of testing and debugging, which will help us as we work on 
the burger menu assignment.

We had a lecture today where our teacher talked about the assignment. It made me reflect on the project, giving me a clearer view of what we 
need to do and how we are going to get there. He also emphasized the 
importance of writing good code from the beginning and avoiding unnecessary comments.

After the lecture, we sat down in the Ericsson laboratory and reviewed our plans for the assignment. We completed the menus, ensuring that each 
burger had a drink, side, and dip.
We also reflected on the tools we are using for the project. We chose Python as the programming language, Flask as the framework, and HTML and 
CSS for the webpage (using CSS just to make the webpage more readable 
for us). We picked Docker for the database and SQL to handle the data.
We also updated and fixed some text in our task documentation so we can refer back to it to see what we have done and what still needs to be 
done. This will also help us when we write the summary of the text.

Since the last diary entry, we have gotten our feature branches in GitHub to work. It took us a few hours to get it to work. The problem we 
found was that when we created the branches in the command interpreter, 
they didn’t connect to GitHub correctly, so we couldn’t use them. However, by either 
creating the branches directly in GitHub or manually setting the paths, we got it to work. Now we can push and pull and work together on the 
feature branches, which will make the project a lot cleaner and easier to 
manage.

Today, we created the web pages for our burger order system. We are using Flask to separate the files so the code is more organized and easier 
to work with. We created separate files for Python, HTML, and CSS, and 
we have different CSS files for each HTML page.
By sitting down today and working together on the web pages, we got a clearer picture of what we, as a group, envision for our finished 
program. This makes it much easier to identify the steps we need to take to 
complete the program.

Tomorrow, we have planned to get together as a group again before the lecture to discuss some more and to review everything, and make sure we 
aren't missing anything.

Since the last diary entry, we have done quite a lot. We have been working on the project from 10 to 17 every day for the last 4 days.
André and I took on the tests, and we started by trying to use pytest and test the routes to the server, and by that way, test the database and the 
connection to the server. But by doing it that way, it had a lot of connection problems with the server and the routing. Pytest also had a hard time copying 
our PSQL database and creating a new one to run the tests from, so instead, we switched to just connecting to the database directly and pulling data from it 
to run the tests. Now, we have a test program that runs the first line of the different product types and checks if it matches the string we provided. We 
also made a test program that checks the connection to the database by printing "connection 200" if it's good.

We are also done with the shopping cart, so we can now order, edit orders, remove, and add items by pressing a + or - button.

Today, we got our kitchen view to work by creating a URL in the app.py 'BurgerOrderer' and sending it to 'kitchenview.' By using JSON, we can take that 
information and use it to see what the customer ordered. I also dockerised the burgerorder aplecation so we can run it from a docker container

So the program itself is complete. the only thing we need to do now is to docker-compose the program and write a summary.

Debug Session Documentation: Ordering a “Big Juicy Burger”
During this debugging session, I focused on the process of ordering a "Big Juicy Burger" in the application. My main objective was to verify that the cart functionality was operating correctly, particularly how 
products were added to the cart, how the cart was displayed on the order page, and how the session was managed.

To begin, I set breakpoints in several locations within the code to ensure I could effectively monitor the application. The first breakpoint was placed in the “initialize_session_cart()” function. 
This function is responsible for initializing the session cart when accessing the front page. I wanted to confirm that the cart was being initialized correctly before any products were added, ensuring that it 
started as an empty cart. Next, I placed a breakpoint in the “/order route” to inspect how the cart data was passed from the server to the template. This was important to check that the cart was being rendered 
accurately on the order page. I also added a breakpoint in the “add_to_session_cart(product_id)” function, which handles adding products to the cart. By looking at this section, I could ensure that when a product 
was ordered, it was added to the cart with the correct details like the items price and quantity.

In order to step through the code effectively, I used VS Code's debugging tools. The Continue function allowed me to run the code until the next breakpoint, while Step Over enabled me to skip over function calls 
when I wanted to observe the high-level flow without diving into the internal logic. I used Step Into to enter functions like “add_to_session_cart()”, where I wanted to closely examine how the cart was 
updated. Step Out helped me exit functions once I had looked at the necessary information and returned to the higher-levels of the code.
During the debugging session, I monitored the “session["cart"]” variable to observe how the cart was modified after adding or removing items. Initially, the cart was empty: “{"products": [], "total_price": 0}”. As 
I added items to the cart I could see the contents of the cart change. With products and modifications reflected in the session. I paid special attention to how “session["cart"]["products"]” was 
updated, confirming that the correct items were added or removed based on customers actions.

To test different scenarios, I placed an order for a different menu item, the “Avocado Dream Burger.” By doing so, I was able to compare how the cart changed with each new product. I confirmed that the correct 
product details appeared in the cart, and that the right code paths were executed. Additionally, I tested clearing the cart midway through an order to see how the application handled this reset. The session cart 
was successfully cleared, returning to its initial empty state without any issues.

The debugging was good and it helped me see that overall cart management and total price calculation were functioning as expected. One of the more challenging aspects of this debugging session was navigating 
session variables across different routes. Since changes to the session data could affect other parts of the application, I had to be careful about the flow of data and how it was managed between the routes.
In conclusion, the debugging session went well. It allowed me to ensure that the functionality of the program was working as expected. Debugging is a good tool to have. It can help you catch small mistakes you have 
made in your program but it can also help you ensure that its working as intended

Since the last diary entry, we have completed the summary for our project. All the containers have been set up, and the connections between them are fully established. With everything functioning as expected, we are now ready to submit the 
project.

This project has taught me a lot from the very beginning. I’ve gained valuable experience with several key technologies, including Docker, Flask, debugging, and Git. Each step brought its own set of challenges and learning opportunities, making 
the project both educational and enjoyable. From setting up containers to troubleshooting code, I’ve developed an understanding of these tools and how they work together. Overall, it’s been a rewarding project with many steps and 
tasks, and I feel more confident in my abilities because of it.

The new skills I’ve learned over the past few months will be incredibly useful in future projects and tasks, both in school and in my future career. This experience has equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to handle similar challenges 
going forward.
