Efter introduktionen på kursen så bildade jag och 3 andra en grupp som nu framöver komma jobba mot uppgiften BurgerOrder. 
Vi tog tillfället och satte oss ner efter föreläsningen och tittade igenom hela uppgiften.
Gruppen konstaterade snabbt att det var väldigt mycket nya tekniker som kommer bli intressanta att titta vidare på senare i kursen.

2024-09-04:
Alla deltagare i gruppen möttes upp för att sätta sig ner och hjälpas åt med installationer av de olika programmen och försöka få ett hum om vad de  
olika programmen är till för och hur de ska nyttjas. 
Efter mötet så var det dags för den andra föreläsningen för kursen. Efter föreläsningen så tycker jag att det kändes bra, men jag är lite "lost" då  
mycket som tas 
upp är förkortningar och spännande program som man aldrig hört talas om, men med tid så kommer jag förstå allt, det är jag övertygad om!

Idag var det laboration. Gruppen satte sig tillsammans i anvisat klassrum och påbörjade med övningsuppgifter. Laddat ner inteljj då jag missade att  
göra det igår, men har inte börjat med att 
försöka bemästra det. Jag tänker nog att jag kommer köra med vs code istället då jag nyttjar det i den andra kursen jag går samtidigt. Jag valde     
istället att försöka lära mig grunderna med github. 
Testat funktioner som push, pull, branch, merge och fork, det har gått bra.

Today we had a lecture that focused on debugging and troubleshooting. One thing I picked up from the lecture was the so called 5S which I feel is a  
good structure to build your foundation on when it comes to work quality and such. I will surely keep 5S in mind while working in the future

Today I went to the lab-enviroment with my group and started with the excercises that revolved around testing and debugging. As I´m writing this     
I´ve been stuck on the excercise 4.6 which i had to debug a language (Java) that I don´t know at all but in the end i managed to solve it by 
changing one small thing, < to >. My insight for this excercise was that I should put my effort to study the things that are relevant for the time 
being and not try to dive in to languages I don´t understand yet. Doing python-course in parallel to this course so python will be my focus of 
language, but what language we will be coding in will be up for debate with the group.

The group made a plan on how to work on the different branches in github. We will have a main branch, a development branch that is a clone 
of main branch. We will also have feature branches for the specifics like kitchenview, menustore and burgerorderer. 
The reason behind this is to isolate and work specifically on the code in each feature so we dont mix everything, and when
time comes and we merge, we merge first to development branch to ensure the merges goes through without problem. This way we will
keep the main branch clean and prevent the code to be bugged when "released".

Since last time writing in the diary not much has happened specifically on the course, until today. The day started with a lecture about the      
different variations on how you can finish this course and different methods. This lecture was a relief in a way because he gave answers to alot of 
concerns I had, such as the implemetation of the code. For me, this is a whole new world, so knowing that I dont have to be an expert on coding to 
solve this gives me peace in mind. 

Afterwards we went to Ericsson Space lab and continued the work on our txt files that have the data on all the ingredients and menus for the 
project. Today I commited changes to menus.txt and  hamburgers.txt and specifically the chicken menus/burgers. The changes was that i made what 
exactly was included in the chicken menus aswell as added for example what a "Spicy chick burger" had in it. 

The group came to a conclusion and decided that we will use python as a language, flask for the framework, drawsql and postgre for the database and 
html and css for the site. Docker will be used as well but later on. 

I feel good after this day, I feel like even though I don't have great knowledge in this field I feel confident that I will grow alot in this field. 
My focus will be on learning tha new tools and try to include myself in all the small parts in the project that is to come.

Today I took a deeper dive into docker and went on to learn about the basics about it. 
I used the excercise document as well as dockers own guides and introduction 
tutorials how to use docker and the basic explanation of it. It's a cool concept. 
Before this program I've worked a little bit with vm and the fact it takes a whole lot quicker to startup a docker 
than a vm is amazing, that was one frustrating part with vm for me. 
If anything, I will in the future try to implement using docker over vm because of the startup time aswell as the simplistic nature of docker.
I will also in the future take my time to watch a longer tutorial on docker and thoroughly learn the commands for it to simplify future work 
with dockers.

Today I went to another lecture with the group and afterwards we sat down and worked on the project.

Since my last update to the diary we as a group has 
been working on adding the finishing touches on our structure inside github.
We made the app.py file to route our HTML & CSS files to enable it to connect to our own local network.

I've done commmits before in the project, but today I made my first code commit which felt really nice. 
It was a commit where i implemented routes in app.py which led to html-sites which I made. 
I also used css to make the html sites a lot better. It's my first time using both html and css, so i'm happy about the outcome of it. 
I struggled a little bit in the beginning but I got a tip from a friend to watch some specific videos on the html and css topic.

Today me and 2 others from the group went to the lab and started working on the exercises. 
We came to the conclusion fast that it was a little vague with how to proceed with the excercises, so we went our own
way to watch some other tutorials about DB's and how to import a DB into docker. 
For me, this feels like a jungle with alot of code that I just insert and then it runs. 
Sometimes its just good to just do that, but for me, I wanna know
exactly what each component does in the code. 
It's a struggle i've had through this course because alot that has been represented to us 
is in a language I don't know, I only just begun learning python.
I must say though, in the beginning it was alot worse, but now when we're 
going through some code in other languages I see the resemblance in it by knowing a bit more about python.

Since the last update we have done quite alot. Me and Aron has been working on setting up the pytest for testing out the routes 
to the server and check the connection to the database. We were following different tutorials on how to set up automatic tests 
and we struggled for quite a bit because we tried to make it so it created a new database all the time to run the tests from. After 
a while we decided to scrap that and switched to connect to the database directly and pulling data from it to run the tests. 
The tests we now have succeeded to make is 5 tests where we test the first line of different 
product types in database and see if it matches the string we gave.
The other test that was made was a simple test to check if we could reach the homepage. 
Right now we have the test for the homepage checker in same directory as app.py because I didn't manage to import connection to 
app.py, but in the future we will put it in with the other tests in a directory 
that is for the tests so we keep all the test code at the same place and make it easier to find it.

Since the last update we are making the finishing touches and dockerizing burgerorderer, kitchenview, menustore and our tests. 
We have also started on writing on reflection and summaries for the whole course. We almost finished the whole reflection, but
we still have a few points to write down, but we have scheduled it for tomorrow/wednesday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2024-10-15--16

Since the last update we cleaned and finished up the summary and reflections. 
We have also merged the feature branches to the development branch and have also been cleaning up the code and making docstrings for the code to easily see what does what. 

We also made a new branch called “debug” in order to make the debug session easier to conduct and do it locally for each and everyone. 

DEBUG SESSION

As I write this I am conducting my own debug session and I chose two simple things, checking the events happening while trying to connect to the home page and monitoring the variable “conn”. 
The debug session is being conducted on the debug branch. 

Start of the debug session: I start off with putting my breakpoints in the file app.py under the directory BurgerOrderer that starts the connection to the app. 
The breakpoints will be on line 16 and 186 in app.py. 

I run app.py and put the localhost address in the browser. When doing so, the debugger jumps down to the first breakpoint which is in the function “front_page()”. 
As the function hasn’t gone through I haven't reached the first site yet, so it is just loading right now. 
The breakpoint is put on the function within the function called “initialize_session_cart()”. 
I use the button “step into” to go into the function and it takes me in app.py to the function. 
The function is here to do exactly what it says, initialize the cart for the session. I use “step out” to jump out of the function and return to continue the other function.

Next step I just step into the print that prints out that the cart has been initialized in the terminal.
Next I step into the return render_template("home.html") which is a flask function. It starts with looking for a template folder and a home.html file inside it. 
Inside the html file it starts with going through metadata on line 5 to give information to a browser. 
Line 5 gives information how the webpage displays on different screen sizes. These instructions are from what I know always put in the head in a html file (haven’t worked a lot with html). 

Next I step into the body and the code in the body represents the visual representation of the home page. At line 10 we see the heading text that greets the user to our webpage. 
At line 11 there is a href that tells the program that if the user clicks on the button (which is on line 12) it will try to go to that URL. 

When it has gone through the whole head and body in the html file it returns the information to the function and the site starts up in my browser.

Next I tried to monitor the variable “conn” in the function “add_to_session_cart“. I use breakpoint and also use the watch function in vscode to check what happens to the variable and if the variable changes. 
The variable is dedicated to start the connection to the database. Stepping into the function you go to the file db.py. 
The file imports psycopg2 which is a PostgreSQL “adapter” that allows python code to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database. 
On line 6 in db.py (conn = psycopg2.connect()) is the line that creates the connection and the rest of the code in the connection is parameters that gives directions on how this connection will be deducted. 
For example, host = “localhost” is a parameter that says that the server will run on our local computer and database = “menustore” tells the function the name of the database. 

The variable “conn” didn’t really change anything while running the debug session since its only use is to establish the connection to the database, so I went on to monitor another variable named total_price in the function calculate_total_price(). 
The function is meant to sum the total price in the cart. I start with adding the “Big juicy burger” to the cart. The variable “conn” starts the connection to the database.

afterwards it goes into the function add_to_session_cart. In this function I chose to see what happens to the variable product. 
The sql query before product variable has been given is using select statement to retrieve a specific column with information from the products table inside db. 
“where product_id = %s” is saying to only return the specific product_id information which was given before this. 
After this it goes into product = cur.fetchone() which says to return the first thing with the product_id and set it to the variable product. 
The variable product changes depending on what the product_id is set to while fetching the information from the database.

The variable total_price will take the product value from the key price from the dictionary it provides and add it with the cart's total price which will be set to 0 if nothing has been added yet. 

Use of debugging buttons: In the debug session I mostly used the “step into” and “step out” buttons, and sometimes the “continue” button when I wanted to skip a whole function. 
The “step over” button I didn’t use that much, didn’t really find it useful in this session.

Summary and reflection: The debug session went quite well for being the first time I used the debugger in vscode. 
Because I’m a beginner to the whole software world I took the route to take simple things to debug and focus on understanding the full process. 
I thought doing the monitoring on the variable conn was easy and easily understandable because it wasn’t that many lines of code to break down. 

One thing I’ve struggled with is to understand how the fetching process works from the database. 
After this session I'm a bit richer with knowledge around functions that work with PostgreSQL, but I still need to do more sessions to learn the commands to feel more comfortable working with databases in the future. 

Will debugging be a useful tool for me? Absolutely, and I would even say it might be a necessity.
For example, one simple reason is that it will be useful to troubleshoot while writing the code to check where the code fails or just check that the code does what it is supposed to do.
